## Hooking it up

![Pinout diagram](https://github.com/Elcomsoft/picodfu/blob/main/media/pinout.png?raw=true)

With this cable, connect:

- [GND] GND (Black)
- [GP2] ID1 (Blue)
- [GP3] ID0 (Yellow)
- [5V]  5V  (Red)

Note: The colors might be different for your cable. I recommend checking the pinout using a voltmeter.

Another cable was observed to have the following pinout:

- [GND] GND (Black)
